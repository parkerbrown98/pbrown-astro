## Background

Hi. My name is Parker. Born and raised in Texas, software development and design piqued my interest from a very young age. From posting tutorials on YouTube at 10 years old to developing clicking games using Visual Basic, I knew I always wanted to develop software for the masses.

I spent countless hours hosting game servers, building communities, and designing web pages using Photoshop's slice tool and Adobe Flash graphics all before I reached middle school. *That* was a good time. It was also when I realized that I had a knack for developing and hosting things that other people could enjoy.
