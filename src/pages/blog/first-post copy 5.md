## How's it today?

Whoa there, cap'n. This piece of `code` is interesting.

Go [to this link](https://google.com) for good vibes.

Check out the following `code` to see what's up.

Python:

```python
from django import util

def boop(bap: int, *args):
    print(bap, *args)
```

### HTML

```html
<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
```
